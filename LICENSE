### Instructions to Set Up Your GitHub Repository

1. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository named `todo-list`.

2. **Initialize the Repository**:
   - If you haven't already done so, navigate to your project folder in the terminal.
   - Run the following commands to initialize your local repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

3. **Link the Remote Repository**:
   - Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you created:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list.git
     ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push your local commits to the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```

5. **Add the README**:
   - Create a file named `README.md` in your project directory.
   - Copy and paste the provided README content into the file, then save it.
   - Add and commit the README:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README file"
     git push
     ```

Now your GitHub repository is set up with your project files and a README! If you need any more help, feel free to ask.
